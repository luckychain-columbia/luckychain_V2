# ⚠️ IMPORTANT: Why Raffle 0 Keeps Failing

The error means Hardhat rejected the transaction because it WOULD FAIL.

## You're Still Using Raffle 0 From Old Session!

Raffle 0 was created BEFORE you restarted Hardhat node.
Even if you redeployed the contract, Raffle 0's data is still there but corrupted.

## The Fix: Restart Hardhat Node (This Clears ALL Raffles)

### Step 1: STOP Hardhat Node

In Terminal 1, press Ctrl+C to stop Hardhat node.

This is KEY - restarting Hardhat node clears the entire blockchain!

### Step 2: Restart Everything Fresh

Terminal 1 (NEW Hardhat session):
cd /Users/alaradinc/Downloads/luckychain_Dec_2_2025/luckychain_V2/LuckyChain_V2/contract
npx hardhat node

Terminal 2 (Deploy):
cd /Users/alaradinc/Downloads/luckychain_Dec_2_2025/luckychain_V2/LuckyChain_V2/contract
npm run deploy -- --network localhost

Terminal 3 (Frontend):
cd /Users/alaradinc/Downloads/luckychain_Dec_2_2025/luckychain_V2/LuckyChain_V2
rm -rf .next node_modules/.cache
npm run dev

### Step 3: Create NEW Raffle

After restarting Hardhat:
- Raffle 0 will be GONE
- You'll need to create a NEW raffle
- That NEW raffle will work! ✅

## Don't Try to Fix Raffle 0 - It's Corrupted!

The solution is to START FRESH by restarting Hardhat node.
